Crelte should have 4 different kind of documentations:

1. A tutorial or onboarding which should help you build a
simple blog website.
2. The textual documentation which gives examples and describes
how the whole things works. This should be read by people who
want to fully understand crelte and what features it has.
It should also be a reference to quickly look up oh, how does that work.
3. The Cookbook here we should have useful examples and code snippets
which are a good solution and example for common problems like language
navigation, pagination, filters etc.
4. The API reference, an auto generated JsDoc with which you can look up
how was this method called again.

## Reference

It would be nice to use auto generated docs like https://jsr.io/@chuchi/utils/doc

## Make a tutorial, for a mini blog
