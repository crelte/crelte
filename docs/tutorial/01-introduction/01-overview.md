## What is Crelte?

Crelte is a framework for developing fast modern digital experiences. It combines the flexible content modeling from [Craft Cms](https://craftcms.com/) and the rapid development from [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/).

## What is Svelte?
In short, Svelte is a way of writing user interface components — like a navigation bar, comment section, or contact form — that users see and interact with in their browsers. The Svelte compiler converts your components to JavaScript that can be run to render the HTML for the page and to CSS that styles the page.

## What is Craft?
In short, Craft CMS is a content management system (CMS) designed for building and managing custom digital experiences. It provides a flexible and intuitive interface for content creators to model, create, and organize content without being restricted by predefined templates or structures. Craft CMS allows developers to build bespoke websites and applications by offering powerful tools for content modeling, templating, and asset management.
